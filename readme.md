#### Project idea: Handwriting Analysis for personality prediction. - Approved

#### Problem statement:
Graphology is the art of studying and analyzing handwriting – A scientific method used to determine a person’s personality, by evaluating various features from the handwriting. To make this method more efficient and reliable, machines can be introduced, to perform FEATURE EXTRACTION and map various personality traits accordingly. This compliments the graphologists, and also increases the speed of analyzing handwritten samples. The basic idea of the project is to analyze handwriting samples, and detect a person’s personality, through it. The user should be able to provide his/her handwriting sample in an image format to the application, then the application would internally perform Machine Learning, in order to give accurate results of personality traits of the user. The results would be based on a few rules of graphology, which are followed, in order to classify the training dataset.

#### Abstract:
Among all the unique characteristics of a human being, handwriting carries the richest information to gain the insights into the physical, mental and emotional state of the writer. Graphology is the art of studying and analyzing handwriting, a scientific method used to determine a person's personality by evaluating various features from the handwriting. The prime features of handwriting such as the page margins, the slant of the alphabets, the baseline etc. can tell a lot about the individual. To make this method more efficient and reliable, introduction of machines to perform the feature extraction and mapping to various personality traits can be done. This compliments the graphologists, and also increases the speed of analyzing handwritten samples. Various approaches can be used for this type of computer aided graphology. The Machine Learning approach (SVM) is one of the key ways to implement this project.The basic idea of the project is to analyze handwriting samples and detect a person's personality through it. The scientific term used for handwriting analysis is Graphology. The user should be able to provide his or her handwriting sample in an image format to the application. The application would internally perform machine learning in order to give accurate results of personality traits of the user, to the user. The results would be based on a few rules of graphology which are followed in order to classify the training dataset - baseline, margins, slant, size, pressure, speed, zones, print writing and cursive writing, connecting strokes, etc. This project will be performed, based on Research Papers related to this field. The entire idea of automating handwriting analysis, makes it easier for people who sits for multiple hours in a day to sit and analyze a person's personality.

#### Approach: 
The development of ANNs followed a heuristic path, with applications and extensive experimentation preceding theory. In contrast, the development of SVMs involved sound theory first, then implementation and experiments. A significant advantage of SVMs is that whilst ANNs can suffer from multiple local minima, the solution to an SVM is global and unique. Two more advantages of SVMs are that that have a simple geometric interpretation and give a sparse solution. Unlike ANNs, the computational complexity of SVMs does not depend on the dimensionality of the input space. ANNs use empirical risk minimization, whilst SVMs use structural risk minimization. The reason that SVMs often outperform ANNs in practice is that they deal with the biggest problem with ANNs, SVMs are less prone to over-fitting.
Four reasons, why we are chosing SVM for this project, over Artificial Neural Networks:
•	SVM gives good result with more accuracy
•	SVM is more time efficient than neural networks
•	SVM can train your machine with a small dataset unlike ANN, generally uses a huge dataset and takes a lot of time to train.
•	SVM aims to assign labels to instances by using support vector machines, learning algorithm, where the different classes are drawn from a finite set of elements to clearly separate them.
