3.	Algorithmic Trading 
4.	Justice on Wheels 


## Description

1.	Facial recognition to detect mood and suggest songs accordingly.

Listening to music has become easier than ever with technology removing friction from the experience. However, in removing barriers to music, technology has overwhelmed us. When you want to listen to music, you must sort through millions and millions of songs, artists and genres. And most commonly, you’ll be indecisive. We want to remove all of that. So the proposition: A platform to detect an individual’s mood and play songs according to the person’s mood. Mood detection for this purpose would be done through facial feature recognition, text based and voice based.

	

2. Handwriting Analysis for personality prediction.

Among all the unique characteristics of a human being, handwriting carries the richest information to gain the insights into the physical, mental and emotional state of the writer. Graphology is the art of studying and analyzing handwriting, a scientific method used to determine a person's personality by evaluating various features from the handwriting.
The prime features of handwriting such as the page margins, the slant of the alphabets, the baseline etc. can tell a lot about the individual. To make this method more efficient and reliable, introduction of machines to perform the feature extraction and mapping to various personality traits can be done.
This compliments the graphologists, and also increases the speed of analyzing handwritten samples. Various approaches can be used for this type of computer aided graphology. Therefore, the Machine Learning approach (SVM) is one of the key ways to implement this project.
The basic idea of the project is to analyze handwriting samples and detect a person's personality through it. The scientific term used for handwriting analysis is Graphology. The user should be able to provide his or her handwriting sample in an image format to the application. The application would internally perform machine learning in order to give accurate results of personality traits of the user, to the user. The results would be based on a few rules of graphology which are followed in order to classify the training dataset - baseline, margins, slant, size, pressure, speed, zones, print writing and cursive writing, connecting strokes, etc.
This project is being performed, based on Research Papers related to this field. The entire idea of automating handwriting analysis, makes it easier for people who sits for multiple hours in a day to sit and analyze a person's personality.


3. Algorithmic Trading 

Algorithmic trading relies on computer programs that execute algorithms to automate some or all elements of a trading strategy. Algorithms are a sequence of steps or rules designed to achieve a goal. They can take many forms and facilitate optimization throughout the investment process, from idea generation to asset allocation, trade execution, and risk management.
Machine learning (ML) involves algorithms that learn rules or patterns from data to achieve a goal such as minimizing a prediction error. These activities include observing the market and analyzing data to form expectations about the future and decide on placing buy or sell orders, as well as managing the resulting portfolio to produce attractive returns relative to the risk.


4. Justice on Wheels 

Access to Legal services in India is very limited, especially in rural areas. In many cases, long running justice process and expensive legal help deter people even to seek justice. A Justice on wheels app(with lawyers network) that provides mobile (at your doorstep ) service for:
•	Affidavit and stamp papers related work
•	Will and trust
•	Legal rights education 
•	Consumer protection related services and others
This “On wheels” idea can be applied to Tutoring, Books and stationary selling.
“Accounting on wheels” can be another opportunity as there are tons of BCOM boys and girls in India looking for work. The company will train them on business and financial accounting
